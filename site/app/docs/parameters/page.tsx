        A change to the listing terms applies to seats bought after it. A change to an auction’s start value does not
        move an auction already running. Raising the report freshness can make a lapsed report fresh again; that is
        intended and pinned by a test.

        The bounds are enforced by <code>Cocoon._checkParams</code>, <code>FloorFeed.setMaxAge</code> and{" "}
        <code>PupateHook.lowerTax</code>; a proposal outside them reverts when the timelock executes it.
