      <h2>Why a reference price</h2>
      <p>
        The vault must know what a seat is worth before it buys one, and it must not take anyone’s word for it. Asks are
        not on-chain, so the reference is built from sales: the <b>median price of the collection’s on-chain sales over
        the last 24 hours</b>. This document calls it the floor; it is a reference built from recent sales, not the
        lowest ask.
      </p>

      <h2>Where it comes from</h2>
      <p>
        The IMD oracle. A request names a question, a panel size and a quorum; a panel of seats answers independently,
        and when enough of them agree the oracle signs an <b>attestation</b> with the answer, the block window it read,
        the panel’s size, quorum and agreement, and a validity window. The signature is EIP-712, domain{" "}
        <code>IdentityMD Oracle</code> version 2, bound to the contract that asked: an attestation issued to one consumer
        is worthless to another.
      </p>
      <p>Each request costs 0.5 IMD. The developer’s keeper requests one every six hours; anyone else may too.</p>

      <h2>What FloorFeed checks</h2>
      <p>
        <code>FloorFeed.report(attestation, signature)</code> is callable by anyone. It stores the price only when all of
        these hold:

      <p>
        A report is fresh for 6 hours after it was issued. Without a fresh report the vault does not buy, and the split
        falls back to 50/50 until the next one arrives.
      </p>

      <h2>The rise limit</h2>
      <p>
        Wash sales can move a median of recent sales. The limit caps how fast that can reach the vault: the stored price
        may rise by at most 25% per 6 hours, measured between the issue times of two reports, whether or not the earlier
        report is still fresh. A report held back until the previous one lapses gains nothing, and reports in quick
        succession cannot compound. A genuine jump larger than the limit is reflected once enough time has passed; until
        then the vault simply buys less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting the question (a timelocked action) clears the stored price, and the first report after that is not
        limited. Setting the same hash again is the way to clear a bad value.
      </p>

      <Aside>
        The <Link href="/feed/#proof">Feed page</Link> shows a real attestation and runs the signature, panel, validity
        and answer checks in your browser. Change the answer by one and the signature check fails.
