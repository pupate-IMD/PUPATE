**A tax on every trade buys Identity MD seats. The seats work in the IMD swarm until they sell, and what they sell for burns PUPATE.**

## What this is

Pupate is a strategy token on Ethereum. A tax on every trade funds a vault, the vault buys **Identity MD
seats** (NFTs of the identity.md collection), each seat is put to work in the IMD swarm and listed for sale
at a falling price, and when a seat sells the proceeds buy PUPATE and burn it.

Nobody holds the keys. Every step — flushing the tax, buying a seat, burning, running the auctions — is a
public function that anyone can call; two of them pay the caller. A 48-hour timelock can lower the tax and
nothing can raise it.

## The cycle

1. **Feed** — a trade pays 6% of its ETH side into the hook.
2. **Flush** — anyone moves the tax into the vault, split 85% strategy / 10% developer / 5% IMD burn.
3. **Cocoon** — when the seat pot can afford one, the vault buys a seat at or under the price the IMD oracle
   reports, and lists it at 1.5× falling to 1.1× over 14 days.
4. **Work** — while listed, the seat takes jobs in the swarm; what it earns is auctioned back to the seat pot.
5. **Emerge** — when the listing fills, the proceeds buy PUPATE and burn it.

## What makes it different

- **The seats work.** A seat in the vault is paired to a worker and earns in the swarm until the day it sells.
- **The price comes from the swarm.** The vault trusts no key for the reference price — only attestations
  signed by the IMD oracle after a panel of seats agreed. You can verify one in your browser on the site.
- **Anyone turns the crank.** The steps are public functions; an agent can run them from a single
  [`skill.md`](site/public/skill.md). No account, no allowlist.
- **The tax only falls.** Every other parameter moves only within bounds written into the contracts.

## In numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| Supply | 1,000,000,000 PUPATE, fixed |
| Allocation | 85% launch pool · 10% IMD swarm · 5% developer, vested over 12 months |
| Tax | 6% of the ETH side of every buy and sell |
| Launch window | buy tax 99% at the open, −1 point/min, 6% after 93 minutes |
| Listing | 1.5× cost falling to 1.1× over 14 days, then flat |
| Caller reward | 0.5% of the ETH a seat purchase or a burn spends |
| Changes | 48-hour timelock, within fixed bounds |

## Build and run

```sh
# contracts
forge test

# the website (http://localhost:3000)
cd site && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Security

The contracts were reviewed twice by independent agents that had not seen the design's reasoning — once for
the tax hook and the price feed, once for the vault. Every finding was fixed before launch; the findings and
their outcomes are in [`docs/REVIEW.md`](docs/REVIEW.md). The IMD swarm reviews the launch again on its own
terms. None of this is a formal audit, and IMD itself has none.
